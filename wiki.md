## Guidelines for everyday life in the lab

-In winter, we take off our boots and leave them on the plastic mat by the door. We leave indoor shoes in the office.

-Please don’t wear strong artificial scents or eat strong-smelling food in the office.

-If you want to drink the coffee regularly in our lab, bring a 500-g pack of beans roughly every other week. If you just drink coffee once in a while, maybe put some coins in the jar beside the machine once in a while.

-Feel free to take snacks from the ‘snack cabinet’ (white/clear set of plastic drawers), and bring in snacks once in a while.

-We try to eat lunch together around 12, and you’re welcome to join! But check the #lunch channel of the slack group to see if anyone is free.
